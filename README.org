*Render HTML source code blocks to images in Org mode for Emacs.* Uses headless
chrome for rendering.

This package is designed as a replacement for
[[https://github.com/krisajenkins/ob-browser][~ob-browser~]], which relies on
[[https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs][PhantomJS]],
[[https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/15344][which is no longer
developed]], and therefore is missing essential features like flex box.

Note that the initial invokation of package functions after installation may
take a while as dependencies are downloaded in the background.
